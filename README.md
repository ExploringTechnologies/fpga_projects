# FPGA_PROJECTS #

## Introduction ##

This repository will contains all things that is to be known about FPGAs. It will also contains projects of my own.
I will try to keep every trace of what i've done so far. 

* The dev kit I'm using is the **Tang nano 20k**  *I'm using the Gowin IDE for now. (A situable alternative will be to use a open source toolchain but it's still in the experimentation)*

You can download it with this link : [Gowin IDE](https://www.gowinsemi.com/en/support/download_eda/)
